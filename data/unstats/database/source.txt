Dear Patricia,

Following up to our discussions earlier in the meeting today, I'm writing to share a few data challenges we've encountered in our efforts to systematically map Sustainable Development Goal indicators from the UNSDG database. Specifically, there seem to be some nuances in how indicators are represented between the CSV files and the CARPHA SDG goal descriptions that raise questions around selecting the correct values.

For some indicators, like 1.3.1 and 3.3.1, a single entry returns multiple data values, making it unclear which value should be chosen. Additionally, the wording doesn't always match precisely between the UNSDG CSV sdg descriptions and CARPHA SDG goal descriptions. For example, SDG 3 indicator 3.2.1 in the CSV is labeled "Under-five mortality rate by sex (deaths per 1000 live births)" rather than just "Under-five mortality rate" as shown on the CARPHA SDG goals.

These discrepancies hinder an automated one-to-one mapping process. We'll need to establish clear guidelines for selecting the right data point when multiple options exist, as well as aligning on common language to describe each indicator across systems. An alternative could be manually formatting the CSV data according to set criteria before importing.

We'd welcome any insight you might have to help address these challenges and ensure a smooth process for systematically tracking progress on the SDGs.
